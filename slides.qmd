## What are the end goals?

:::{.incremental}
- Save time;
- reduce mistakes;
- improve transparency; and
- fun?
:::

. . .

More generally, we want to make our lives, and those of our colleagues (both current and future) easier.

## Not just a technical problem

- How do you curate what you produce?
- How do you review the work?
- Do you adapt a standardised approach within the group?

---

## Documentation is key

. . . 

This includes:

- The source code (what other developers look at).
- Function documentation and package vignettes (end user documentation).
- Onboarding / group documentation

. . .

This applies to all code, not just packaged code.

---

## R packages

- A way to distribute useful functionality (e.g. statistical techniques).
- Approx 20,000 packages on CRAN.
- Enforce a structure for you to work to.
- Lot's of tooling available to help (both built in to R and through wider package ecosystem).

---

## Source hosting

[git](https://git-scm.com/) is great to use as your version control system and [GitHub](github.com) great for hosting your repositories. Lot's of tooling built around both of these.

---

## Package hosting

- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    - Released packages; simple to use; provides integration testing as dependencies move forward.
- [R-Universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/)
    - Useful for sharing binaries of packages not on CRAN
- [drat](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat/)
    - Self hosting of packages (source only), easiest to use with GitHub


---

## Challenges

- IT infrastructure
- Ensuring packages that are not on CRAN continue to work
- Capacity

---

## Getting started

- [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/)
- [Happy Git and Github for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)
